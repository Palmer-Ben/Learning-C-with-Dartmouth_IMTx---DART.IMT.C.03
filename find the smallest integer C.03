The goal of this problem is to find the smallest integer in a list of numbers.

To help you with this task, please write a function called min() that finds and returns the smallest amongst two integers (be sure to also write a prototype for this function). The function thus takes two integers as input and returns the smallest of the two. This function will use an if statement with a condition that contains either "less than" or "greater than".

Next, please use min() in your main function to work your way through an entire list of numbers in order to find its minimum. The first number you read gives the number of elements in the list of integers under consideration. You will then read the integer values, using min() to keep only the smallest integer read at each step. In the end, please print out the smallest integer in the list.


#include <stdio.h>
//prototype
int min(int x, int y);

int main(void) {
    //variables
	int num_int;
	int integers;
	int i = 0;
	int smallest_int;
	
	//num of integers to look through
	scanf("%d",&num_int);
	
	//set first num to smallest int found so far
	scanf("%d",&smallest_int);
	
	//using a for loop, scan in each element, check against current smallest, resize if needed, continue till end	
	for(i=1;i<num_int;i++){
	    scanf("%d",&integers);
	    smallest_int = min(smallest_int,integers);
	}
	
	printf("%d",smallest_int);
	
	return 0;
}

//check two nums and keep smallest value
int min(int x, int y){
    if(x<y){
        return x;
    }else{
        return  y;
    }
}
