before starting to market your product. Your program keeps track of a person's age, but in order to be more secretive you work with a pointer rather than the variable that stores the age directly. 

You are provided with a main function -- please complete it. Do not change any of the lines of code that have already been completed. Please only change the lines that are currently comments.


//Example

//Input:

45

//Output

The secret address is...fffc                                                    
Now take three drops of the magic elixir.                                       
Did the elixir work? You are 40 years old!


#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {

    int age;

    // create pointer
    int * ageptr;

    scanf("%d", &age);
    
    // put age address in ageptr pointer
    ageptr = &age;

    printf("The secret address is... ");
    
    //print out age address
    printf("%p\n",ageptr);

    printf("Now take three drops of the magic elixir. \n");
    
    //assign new value of minus 5 to age via ageptr
    * ageptr = * ageptr - 5;
    
    printf("Did the elixir work? You are %d years old!", age);

    return 0;

}
